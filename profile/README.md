## Hi there 👋

- 🙋‍♀️ We are developing a Toolkit for _Decentralized Federated Collaborative Economy_?
- 🌈 You can get involved contributing to the code, writing/edting documentation, spreading the word, and many more?
- 👩‍💻 The MVP is [running on Galaxy](https://altru.eu.meteorapp.com/) what is attached to the [main repository](https://github.com/DeCentral-Budapest/altruist-platform-meteor "DeCentral-Budapest/altruist-platform-meteor: Toolkit for Decentralized Federated Collaborative Economy")
- 🍿 The project won the meteor hackathon
- 🧙 We believe in the abundance-based society and the power of altruism.
